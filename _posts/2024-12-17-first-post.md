# Welcome to My Development Journey 🚀

I'm thrilled to finally launch this site to document my journey as a software developer. Let me introduce myself first—my full name is **Khairun Nashirin**, but my friends simply call me **Kirun**, and I’m totally comfortable with that. So, let’s be friends—feel free to call me **Kirun**! 👋

## What You Can Expect Here

In this space, I’ll be sharing blog-style posts about my experiences, challenges, and learnings as a **software engineer** working at a startup company in South Jakarta. I've been part of this journey for **6 years** now, and I’m proud to have contributed to projects like:

- **[Houzcall](https://houzcall.co.id)** — where I build and maintain **native Android and iOS apps**.
- **[Kubikasi](https://kubikasi.id)** — where I focus on **native Android development**.

All of these apps are built natively, without using cross-platform frameworks. Besides mobile development, I also play a role as a **backend development supervisor**—so I get to explore both sides of the development process.

## What I’m Working On Now 🛠️

Currently, my team and I are working on a major migration for Android: **moving from XML-based layouts to Jetpack Compose**! It’s been an exciting (and sometimes challenging) process, and I can’t wait to share my experiences and learning journey with you in future posts. 

If you’re curious about Jetpack Compose or considering similar migrations, stay tuned—I’ll definitely dive into the details soon.
